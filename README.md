Discord bot that posts standings in the major football leagues. Uses API-football to do so.

The bot's main ideology is keeping API calls as low as possible. The bot watches the leagues it's interested in and then stores their standings internally, spitting them out when asked rather than calling the API every time.

The bot is a palace fan and this feature is not optional
